# Starter Project for Webdriver
This is a project I started one night with my bro-in-law, Donghee, to look
at the different ideas to start a Node.js based testing project. 

To run this project, you will need to:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Download Chromedriver and make sure it is in your path
4. Run `npm run test` to kick off the tests
